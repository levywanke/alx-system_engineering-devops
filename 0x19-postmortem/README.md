Postmortem: Outage Incident at Web Stack Debugging Project

## Issue Summary:
- **Duration:** May 7, 2024, 10:00 AM - May 7, 2024, 12:00 PM (UTC)
- **Impact:** The web stack debugging project website experienced intermittent downtime, with users unable to access the platform. Approximately 30% of users were affected, reporting slow loading times and occasional errors.
- **Root Cause:** The outage was caused by a misconfigured Nginx server, resulting in a bottleneck in the network traffic routing.

## Timeline:
- 10:00 AM: Issue detected through monitoring alerts indicating server response time exceeding thresholds.
- 10:05 AM: Engineering team notified of the issue by automated alert system.
- 10:10 AM: Initial investigation focused on backend server performance and database queries.
- 10:20 AM: Assumption made that database connection issues were causing the slowdown.
- 10:30 AM: Additional investigation revealed no anomalies in database queries or server load.
- 10:45 AM: Issue escalated to the infrastructure team for further analysis.
- 11:00 AM: Network traffic analysis identified misconfigured Nginx server as the root cause.
- 11:30 AM: Configuration settings corrected to optimize network routing and alleviate congestion.
- 12:00 PM: Service fully restored, and users reported normal website performance.

## Root Cause and Resolution:
- **Root Cause:** Misconfigured Nginx server resulted in inefficient routing of network traffic, causing congestion and slowdown.
- **Resolution:** Configuration settings on the Nginx server were corrected to properly route network traffic and optimize server performance.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:
- Review and update Nginx server configurations to ensure proper network routing.
- Implement automated monitoring for Nginx server performance to detect configuration issues early.
- Conduct regular audits of server configurations to identify and address potential bottlenecks.
